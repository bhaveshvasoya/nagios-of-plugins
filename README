Open Fusion Nagios Plugins
==========================

Prerequisites
-------------

Nagios::Plugin from CPAN (>= 0.14).

If you want to use check_by_ssh to do local checks on remote boxes, you want 
to setup an ssh key (with no passphrase) for your master nagios user and add 
it to the '.ssh/authorized_keys' file for each of your remote nagios users. 
Depending on your sshd config on the remote box, you might also need to tweak 
the remote AuthorizedUsers setting, and/or tweak firewalls.


check_yum / check_up2date
-------------------------

This plugin checks for outstanding yum or up2date packages on the given host. 
Because both yum and up2date need to run as root in order to be able to update 
package headers, you normally want to run these plugins via sudo, adding the 
following to your 'sudoers' file on the remote box:

  # Allow nagios to run certain plugins as root
  nagios  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_up2date,/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_yum

I usually add check commands like the following:

  # 'check_yum'
  define command {
    command_name    check_up2date
    command_line    $USER1$/check_by_ssh -4 -H $HOSTNAME$ -t 20 -C 'sudo /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_yum'
  }
  # 'check_up2date'
  define command {
    command_name    check_up2date
    command_line    $USER1$/check_by_ssh -4 -H $HOSTNAME$ -t 20 -C 'sudo /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_up2date'
  }


check_qmailq
------------

check_qmailq needs to have access to the qmail mail queue to work, so it
either needs to run as root (as above e.g. via sudo), or you need to add
your nagios user to the 'qmail' group. The latter is normally reasonably
sensible - the qmail group has only read access to the queues in question.
